    #region If there's a need to change default robots movement speed or rotation:
    /*
    1. Open my "RobotsStorage" script
    2. You should see a region called "Adding Robots to the List", if there's a "+" sign on that line press it
    3. You should see few robot class declarations. For exaple "firstRobot = new Robot(...) etc.
    Hover on word "Robot" it should be colored in green. You should see tooltip with passed variable types and names.
    It will help you understand the meaning of numbers passed in constructor.
    4. Now just change the numbers to values you need.
    
    !!!Oh btw defaul robot is "firstRobot"!!!
